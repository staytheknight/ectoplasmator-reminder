Do you ever forget your Ectoplasmator in your bank and feel like you are missing out on prayer xp?<br> 

Well fear no more!

This plugin places an icon of an Ectoplasmator over creatures that have the Spectral attribute.<br>

The list of creatures with this attribute can be found on the [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Spectral_(attribute)).
